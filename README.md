# Greetings!

Professionally I'm working as a fullstack engineer with Python and JavaScript at [SD Software-Design GmbH](https://github.com/SD-Software-Design-GmbH)

Personally I'm currently tinkering at my personal website/photography portfolio.

I'm currently learning functional programming with F# (always open for advice on that!)
