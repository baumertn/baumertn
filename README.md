# Hey!

I'm working as a senior software engineer at [SD Software-Design GmbH](https://github.com/SD-Software-Design-GmbH). Currently, my focus there is on platform engineering and operations.

Professionally I program in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Go.

In my spare time, I'm tinkering with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) for web things.
